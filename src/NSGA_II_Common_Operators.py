#-------------------- Population evaluation --------------------

# Evaluates every individual of the given population using the
# metrics contained in "objective_funcs".
# "objective_funcs" is a list of tuples (function, [arguments])
# meant to provide optional arguments to the evaluation functions
# if needed (for example, data for model training).
# It can also attempt to decrease computation time by means of
# parallelism ("n_cores"), but if the metrics are too simple
# it can lead to worse performance by overhead.

#-------------------- Selection process --------------------

# Binary tournament. Takes as many random individuals as 2 * "pool_size"
# and outputs "pool_size" winners as individuals selected for crossover.
# For each pair, we choose the individual with the lower rank; if there's
# a draw, we favor the one with greater crowding distance.
# "sort_scores" contains (front, crowding distance) for each individual.
# Returns an array of individuals.
