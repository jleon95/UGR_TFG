The matrices stored in this folder contain 2 columns, corresponding to:
-Logistic Regression (with the best configuration of individuals and generations)
-Support Vector Machine (with the best configuration of individuals and generations)
and 15 rows, since 15 different start points (seeds) are considered in order to make statistically significant claims about their performance differences

The output array is then 15 rows x 2 columns of the best Kappa values of LogReg and SVM feature selection runs for each individual (104, 107, 110)
