The matrices stored in this folder contain 3 columns, corresponding to:
-300 individuals and 150 generations
-500 individuals and 100 generations
-800 individuals and 200 generations
and 15 rows, since 15 different start points (seeds) are considered in order to make statistically significant claims about their performance differences

The output array is then 15 rows x 3 columns of the best Kappa values of LogReg feature selection runs for each individual (104, 107, 110)
