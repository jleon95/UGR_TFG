The matrices stored in this folder contain 3 columns, corresponding to UniformCrossover, SinglePointCrossover, TwoPointCrossover,
and 15 rows, since 15 different start points (seeds) are considered in order to make statistically significant claims about their performance differences

The output array is then 15 rows x 3 columns of the best Kappa values of LogReg feature selection runs for each individual (104, 107, 110)
