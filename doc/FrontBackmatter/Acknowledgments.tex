\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

I would like to express my gratitude to my supervisors, Julio and Samuel, for giving me the opportunity to work in a project I have enjoyed at a personal level. \\

\noindent
I would also like to highlight the work of those professors whose unfaltering dedication has helped many students like me become a bit more of an engineer. \\

\noindent
Finally---for how could it have been otherwise---, I wish to acknowledge the support of my family and friends, who ultimately make life worth living. \\

\noindent
Many thanks, especially, to Eva, \\
and to Laura, Germán, Cristina, Antonio and Sergio, \\
for helping me get back on the right track.
