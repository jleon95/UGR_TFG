\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

I would like to express my gratitude to my supervisors, Julio and Samuel, for giving me the opportunity to work in a project I have enjoyed at a personal level. \\

I would also like to highlight the work of those professors whose unfaltering dedication has helped many students like me become a bit more of an engineer. \\

A special mention is owed to the University of Essex, and to John Q. Gan in particular, for providing the dataset used in this work. \\

Finally---for how could it have been otherwise---, I wish to acknowledge the support of my family and friends, who ultimately make life worth living.
