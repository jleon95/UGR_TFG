\chapter{Experimental results}\label{ch:experiments}
%************************************************ 

In this chapter, we start by detailing in section \ref{sec:technologies} the choice of technologies in order to obtain experimental results. After that, these results will be discussed in order of application in sections \ref{sec:res_fs} (feature selection), \ref{sec:res_so} (structure optimization) and \ref{sec:res_lo} (learning optimization). By the end, we will have empirical evidence to point us in promising directions, which we will subsequently talk about in the form of conclusions and future work.
