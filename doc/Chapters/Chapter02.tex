\section{Neural networks as classifiers}

	One of the most popular use cases of \acs{ANN}s is supervised learning; what distinguishes it from unsupervised learning is the existence of labeled examples that guide the learning stage, against the need to infer all information. Supervised learning can be further divided into classification and regression: the former aims to split a set of data into two or more groups, while the latter is more of a function approximation. Since our job will consist in recognizing several types of \acs{EEG} patterns, the discussion from here on will focus on the particular details of classification.
